Assignment 1 consisted of 5 lisp sessions and 2 coding challenges. The lisp sessions were just copies of what the professor did in class.

The first challenge was the "Three Quartes Far Corners" Assignment. I had to make a lisp program that would calculate the diagonal length 
of a rectangle that had 3 quarters in a row on the inside.

The second challenge was the "Goat Tethering Problem". I had to write a lisp program that calculated the total grazing area of a goat that is
teathered to the corner of a 70 x 100 (unit) barn.
