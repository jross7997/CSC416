Assignment 2 consisted of two programming Challenges that focused on teaching us how to write methods in Lisp.

Challenge 1 was the Calculator challenge. This had me writing two separate methods, calculator-LR and calculator-RL. Each prompts the user 
to type in a mathematical expression with 3 operands and 2 operators. So in the format of OPERAND OPERATOR OPERAND OPERATOR OPERAND. The only 
difference between the two is the order it reads it in. Calculator-LR reads from Left to Right and Calculator-RL reads from right to left.

Challenge 2 was the perimeter of a triangle challenge. this had me writing two more methods. One that calculates the distance between two points and
 one that calculates the perimeter of a triangle. The distance function accepts 4 parameters, which is enough data to get 2 distinct points. 
 The perimeter function takes in 6 parameters, which gives enough data to determine the perimeter of a triangle.
